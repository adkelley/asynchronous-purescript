* Asynchronous PureScript
The modules /Aysnc/, /Basics/, /Fork/, /Parallel/, /Stack/, and /Sync/ demonstrate the ability to work with asynchronous effects.  They are copied directly from Drew Olson's blog post, [[https://blog.drewolson.org/asynchronous-purescript][Asynchronous Purescript]].  
Please read his blog post for further information.

** Installation
Install [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/purescript][purescript]] and [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/spago][spago]] locally using yarn or npm:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yarn install
#+END_SRC

** Running these modules
After you have installed purescript and spago (see above).  You can run each of the modules with the following command, where /name_of_module/ is the name of one of the modules 
given above (e.g., /Fork/):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ yarn spago run name_of_module
#+END_SRC

If you want to time a module:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ yarn spago bundle-app name_of_module
$ time node index.js
#+END_SRC
